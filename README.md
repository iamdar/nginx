# nginx

Welcome to my nginx practice repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains all my practice files related to nginx. I am using Vagrant to load these files and create a consistent development environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Vagrant installed on your machine. Once you have Vagrant set up, you can easily spin up the environment by running:

```bash
vagrant up
